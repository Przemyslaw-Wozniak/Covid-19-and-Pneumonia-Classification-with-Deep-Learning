# Project summary

Here, I'm developing a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. We have a set X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, I will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan.
